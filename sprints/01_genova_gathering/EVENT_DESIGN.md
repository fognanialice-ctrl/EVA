## BUSINESS MODEL

| Who | Pays | Gets |
|---|---|---|
| Participants | Free | The full EVA experience |
| Vendors/partners | Low participation fee | Access to ~25 aligned women, brand visibility in an elevated context, community association |
| Optional practices (yoga, etc.) | Small fee from participant | Practitioner gets paid, EVA may take a small cut or not |

**Vendor participation fee** should be low enough to be accessible for small artisans/practitioners but enough to cover basic event costs (venue, F&B, printing, flowers).

---

## PARTNERS & CORNERS

*Each partner pays a low participation fee. Most elements are NOT separate corners — they are woven into the apartment as part of the living space. The event should feel like walking into a home where everything is beautiful and intentional, not a venue with stations.*

### SPATIAL INTEGRATION LOGIC

| Element | Where it lives | Needs dedicated space? |
|---|---|---|
| La Strega del Castello candles | Diffused throughout the apartment — on tables, windowsills, shelves | No — they ARE the atmosphere |
| Martina Geroni ceramics | Displayed throughout as decor + used as vessels for food/drinks | No — they ARE the objects |
| Erboristeria products | Small artistic clusters around the apartment — bathroom, entry, shelves | No — they ARE the beauty |
| Cookie decorating | Kitchen — served and decorated there, small and intimate | No dedicated corner — uses existing kitchen |
| Teaps tea service | Living room — a warm presence, pouring and offering | No dedicated corner — integrates into the room |
| Live artist | Wherever feels natural — a corner of the living room, near a window | Minimal — just her + easel/materials |
| Valeria (Tarot) | **Yes — needs a semi-private nook** (a bedroom, an alcove, a quiet room) | **Yes** |
| Fiori di Bach consultations | **Yes — needs a quiet, semi-private space** for personal conversations | **Yes** |
| Le Parole (writing) | A table, a windowsill, a quiet spot — self-guided | No — just a beautiful surface + materials |

**Dedicated spaces needed: only 2** (Valeria + Fiori di Bach)
**Everything else dissolves into the apartment.**

### Corner 1 — Erboristeria: Natural Beauty + Fiori di Bach
**Beauty as care, rooted in nature**
- Local woman-owned erboristeria (also does Fiori di Bach)
- Sensory experience: women can touch, smell, try natural products
- Fiori di Bach mini-consultations — short, personal, gentle (could be optional paid element)
- Products available for purchase without pressure
- She IS the corner: her presence, knowledge, warmth
- **Status:** To confirm

### Corner 2 — Martina Geroni: Ceramics
**Beauty you can hold**
- Italian ceramic artist (Lodi), works in grès with natural clays, minimalist lines, earth-as-material
- Pieces displayed as part of the space's beauty (not a stall) + used as vessels for food/drinks (women eat and drink from art)
- Available for purchase
- Possible activation: brief hands-on clay moment (not a workshop — just contact with the material)
- Reference: [Martina Geroni on Homo Faber](https://2022.homofaber.com/en/discover/discover-martina-geroni)
- **Status:** To confirm

### Corner 3 — Valeria: Tarot
**Intuition as beauty**
- Valeria (friend of founder) — short personal readings (10-15 min)
- The "practical magic" corner: EVA's spirituality made tangible without being heavy
- Free short pull (1-3 cards) or optional paid deeper reading
- Setting: beautiful cloth, candles, a semi-private nook — not a party trick
- Warm, grounded, no fear-based language
- **Status:** Confirmed (friend)

### Corner 4 — La Strega del Castello: Candles & Fragrance
**Beauty you can breathe**
- Caterina Roncati's artisan fragrance house, born from a three-generation Genoese pharmacy lineage
- Based in Genova (Piazza Dante) — naturopathy, phytotherapy, herbalism background
- Candles, perfumes, body care, home scents — all crafted from ancient artisanal recipes
- Corner could be: scent discovery experience — women smell, explore, find "their" scent
- Candles could double as part of the event's sensory design (the space smells like the partner, not a generic diffuser)
- Products available for purchase
- Reference: [Strega del Castello](https://www.stregadelcastello.it/en/) | [Le Strade di Genova feature](https://le-strade.com/la-strega-del-castello-genova/)
- **Status:** To approach

### Corner 5 — Teaps: Tea Ritual
**Beauty in slowness**
- Andrea and Riccardo (@teaps_) — Genova-based tea culture project, known for itinerant tea times in Genoese villas
- They bring tea as an experience, not just a drink — the ritual, the pause, the care
- Could serve as the welcome drink station and/or a dedicated tea corner throughout
- Ties beautifully to the "nourishment" theme — warmth, slowness, intention
- Reference: [Teaps Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/teaps_/) | [Tè21 event feature](https://le-strade.com/te21-by-teaps-evento-te-genova/)
- **Status:** To approach

### Corner 6 — Cookie Decorating Station
**Beauty you can taste**
- Small, playful, tactile: "decorate your cookie" or similar micro-experience
- Ties to the theme: beauty as nourishment, literally — making something beautiful and edible with your hands
- Must be compact (small kitchen space) — pre-baked cookies + decorating supplies (icing, flowers, edible elements)
- Self-guided or with one person gently helping
- NOT a baking class — just a sweet, low-barrier creative moment
- Could partner with a local pasticceria or baker (woman-owned preferred)
- **Status:** Need to find partner/baker

### Corner 7 — Live Artist
**Beauty being made**
- A woman artist painting/drawing/creating live during the event
- NOT performing — just present, working, visible
- Her process becomes part of the atmosphere: women can watch, pause, be drawn to the act of creation
- The piece created during the event becomes part of EVA's story (could be auctioned, gifted, kept)
- Possible interactions: she sketches quick portraits of women who sit with her, or women add a brushstroke to a communal piece
- **Status:** Need to find artist (Genova-based preferred)

### Corner 8 — Le Parole (The Words)
**Reflection without pressure**
- Self-guided corner: beautiful journals, curated prompts, good paper, real pens
- "Letter to yourself" station: write, seal, EVA mails it to you in 3 months
- Communal book/wall where each woman writes one line about beauty
- No host needed — the corner speaks for itself
- **Status:** EVA produces (low cost, high impact)

## EVENT FLOW — GUEST JOURNEY

### The Arc
**Arrive softly → Explore beauty → Connect naturally → One shared moment → Close with warmth → Linger**

### Timed Run of Show (approx. 14:00–19:00)

#### PHASE 1 — ARRIVAL & LANDING (14:00–15:00)
*"Come as you are. Slow down. You're here."*

- Staggered arrival window (60 min) — no hard start time
- Greeted at the door warmly (founder + 1-2 hosts)
- Welcome drink: something beautiful (herbal infusion from the erboristeria? botanical spritz? both alcoholic and non-alcoholic)
- Soft background music playing
- Light scent: fresh flowers, subtle and natural
- **Arrival card:** each woman writes her first name + one word for "what makes you feel beautiful" — placed on a communal display (not shared aloud)
- Women explore the space, drift to corners, settle in
- All corners already alive and inviting

#### PHASE 2 — OPENING THE FIELD (15:00–15:10)
*"A soft gathering of attention."*

- Founder gathers everyone gently (a chime, not a microphone)
- Welcome: 2-3 minutes MAX — what EVA is, what today is about, what it isn't
- One micro-moment of connection: "Turn to the woman nearest you. Tell her something beautiful you noticed about her since you arrived." (60 seconds)
- Release back into the space

#### PHASE 3 — THE LIVING ROOM (15:10–16:30)
*"Choose your own rhythm."*

- The apartment is alive — women flow freely
- No announcements, no visible schedule
- Hosts gently present if someone seems unsure
- Beautiful grazing bites available throughout
- Drinks flowing: Teaps tea in the living room, herbal infusions, wine, botanical drinks
- Music continues
- This is the heart — most of the event lives here

**→ "Il Tè delle Due" — THE DESIGNED CONNECTION MOMENT (embedded in Phase 3)**
*(See detailed design below)*
- Happens naturally around 15:45–16:15 during the flow
- A host gently invites women to join "il tè delle due" — a tea pairing moment
- Women draw a card, find their match, sit together for tea and a conversation
- 15 minutes. One real exchange. Then they're free again.
- Completely optional — no one is rounded up. But the invitation is warm enough that most will join.

#### PHASE 4 — THE DEEPENING (16:30–17:00)
*"One shared moment — embodied, not intellectual."*

- A single gentle guided experience for the group — options:
  - **Guided movement/breathwork** (20 min, optional paid yoga/movement session could follow)
  - **Collective beauty ritual** — each woman receives a small natural element (flower, herb, stone from the erboristeria) and places it into a shared arrangement while a short poetic reading is spoken
  - **A moment with the hands** — Martina guides a brief tactile moment with clay (not a workshop — 10 minutes of contact with material, eyes closed, feeling the earth)
- Followed by 15 min of open space — women breathe, connect, reflect

#### PHASE 5 — CLOSING & THE GOLDEN WALL (17:00–17:20)
*"You already have what you came for."*

- Founder gathers softly
- NO circle share. NO "takeaways."
- A brief poetic close — a few words, a reading, a shared gesture
- **Final moment with the Golden Wall** — founder reads a few lines from it aloud (anonymous, no attribution). The room hears itself.
- **The gift:** each woman leaves with a small beautiful object — a Martina Geroni piece? A small herbal blend from the erboristeria? A sealed card with a beauty prompt for the week? (decide based on budget and partner generosity)
- Music shifts warm and uplifting

#### PHASE 6 — THE LINGER (17:20–19:00+)
*"Stay. No one is rushing you."*

- Aperitivo energy — drinks and bites continue
- Music lifts slightly
- This is where the deepest spontaneous connections happen
- Women photograph the Golden Wall, exchange contacts, linger
- Some women leave, some stay another hour
- Natural, unforced ending

---

## F&B DIRECTION

- **Style:** refined grazing throughout — NOT a meal, not a sit-down, not a buffet line
- Continuous small bites: Ligurian-inspired (focaccette, seasonal crudités, nuts, fruit, small baked things)
- Beautiful presentation: Martina's ceramics as vessels if possible
- Real glasses, linen napkins, flowers everywhere
- Strong non-alcoholic program (herbal infusions, botanical drinks — tie to erboristeria)
- Wine available but not the centerpiece
- Local sourcing, dietary options naturally present (no labels, just variety)

## SENSORY DESIGN

- **Visual:** EVA's presence through curation, not logos. Martina's ceramics as decor. Flowers. Books. Beautiful objects

## DESIGN FEATURE: "IL TÈ DELLE DUE" — The Solo Attendee Solution

### The Problem
A woman who comes alone — especially if she's introverted or new to this world — can drift through a beautiful apartment, admire everything, and still leave without a single real conversation. The flowing format is EVA's strength, but it can also let people slip through without connecting. We need ONE moment that gently ensures every woman meets at least one other woman in a way that feels natural, not forced.

### The Solution: Il Tè delle Due (Tea for Two)

**What it is:** A paired tea moment, embedded softly into the middle of the event.

**How it works:**

1. **The Setup (invisible)**
   - At arrival, every woman receives a beautiful small card along with her name card
   - On each card: a single word — a quality, a feeling, a poetic fragment
   - Examples: "coraggio" / "radici" / "luna" / "sale" / "fiore selvatico" / "la prima neve"
   - Each word exists on exactly two cards — creating pairs
   - Women don't know they're being paired. They slip the card into a pocket, a bag — it's just a beautiful object

2. **The Invitation (~15:45)**
   - A host gently announces (not over a mic — walking through the rooms, softly): "Se volete, portatevi il tè e la vostra parola — trovate l'altra."
   - ("If you'd like, bring your tea and your word — find the other one.")
   - Women look at their card. They start asking around: "What's your word?"
   - The search itself is the icebreaker — it creates laughter, curiosity, movement

3. **The Sit (15:50–16:10)**
   - Once paired, each duo finds a spot — a sofa, a windowsill, the garden
   - Teaps pours tea for each pair (the act of being served together creates intimacy)
   - On the table/tray: a small card with ONE conversation prompt. Warm, not heavy:
     - "Raccontami una cosa bella che ti è successa di recente e che non hai raccontato a nessuno."
       *(Tell me something beautiful that happened recently that you haven't told anyone.)*
     - "Qual è una cosa che fai solo per te, che ti fa sentire viva?"
       *(What's something you do just for yourself that makes you feel alive?)*
     - "Se potessi regalare una sensazione a tutte le donne qui, quale sarebbe?"
       *(If you could gift one feeling to every woman here, what would it be?)*
   - 15 minutes. One cup of tea. One real exchange.

4. **The Release**
   - No debrief. No sharing with the group. The conversation belongs to them.
   - They keep their word card as a memento — it now carries the memory of that person.

**Why it works for EVA:**
- It's playful, not therapeutic
- It uses an object (the card) as a bridge — not a facilitator pointing at you
- The search for your match creates energy and movement
- It's opt-in in spirit (the host says "se volete" — if you'd like) but socially easy to join
- It ties to Teaps naturally (they're already there, pouring tea)
- It guarantees that every woman has at least one meaningful 1:1 exchange
- It gives women a story to tell: "I was paired with a stranger and we talked for 20 minutes about..."
- The word card becomes a keepsake — they'll remember their word, and the woman who shared it

**Production needs:**
- 50 beautiful cards, hand-lettered or beautifully printed (25 pairs of words)
- 25 conversation prompt cards (small, placed on trays)
- Teaps coordination (pour for pairs as they settle)

## DESIGN FEATURE: "LA PARETE D'ORO" — The Iconic Visual Anchor

### The Problem
The event is full of beautiful moments — but there's no single, iconic image that defines EVA. No visual that every woman photographs, that becomes the social media signature, that people recognize and associate with the brand. We need one visual centerpiece that is participatory, builds through the event, and is undeniably beautiful.

### The Solution: La Parete d'Oro (The Golden Wall)

**What it is:** A large, beautiful surface (a wall, a panel, a fabric) where every woman writes or places one thing — and by the end of the event, it has become a collective work of art.

**The Design:**

1. **The Surface**
   - A large panel (could be: a linen cloth stretched on a frame, a section of wall covered in thick cream/gold paper, a wooden board painted matte white or soft blush)
   - Size: at least 150cm x 200cm — large enough to photograph and to hold 50 contributions
   - Positioned in a prominent, well-lit spot (near a window, in the main room, at the entrance)

2. **The Prompt**
   - Written at the top in beautiful hand-lettered script:
   - **"Cosa ti fa sentire bella?"** *(What makes you feel beautiful?)*
   - Or the English/bilingual version if the crowd warrants it

3. **The Materials**
   - Gold markers/pens (the "oro" in Parete d'Oro — everything written becomes golden)
   - Or: small cards in warm tones (cream, blush, terracotta) that women write on and pin/stick to the surface
   - Or: dried flowers, ribbon, small objects women can attach alongside their words
   - The materials should be beautiful enough that the act of writing feels special

4. **How It Builds**
   - Women are invited to add their answer at any point during the event — no specific moment, no announcement
   - The arrival card prompt ("one word for what makes you feel beautiful") feeds naturally into this: some women will transfer their word, others will write something new
   - Early arrivals see a mostly empty wall. Late arrivals see it filling up. By closing, it's full — 50 answers in 50 handwritings
   - The live artist could work near or on the wall — her art intertwining with the women's words

5. **The Closing Moment**
   - During Phase 5, founder stands before the wall and reads a few lines aloud — anonymous, no attribution
   - The room hears itself. 50 women hearing what 50 women feel. No one knows whose words are whose.
   - This replaces any need for a circle share — the wall does the sharing

6. **After the Event**
   - The wall is photographed beautifully (this is THE image for post-event content)
   - It can be preserved: rolled up if it's fabric/paper, kept as an artifact of EVA's first gathering
   - Excerpts shared on IG (close-up shots of individual answers, the full wall, women writing on it)
   - Becomes a recurring element at every future EVA gathering — the Parete d'Oro is always there, always different

**Why it works for EVA:**
- It's the single most shareable moment — 50 handwritten answers to "what makes you feel beautiful" is visually stunning and emotionally magnetic
- It builds through the event, so it creates a sense of growing collective presence
- It gives women a reason to return to it (check what others have written, add their own)
- It's the closing moment without forcing anyone to speak
- It becomes EVA's visual signature — recognizable, repeatable, scalable to any city
- It costs almost nothing (a panel, gold pens, good paper)
- It ties directly to the theme: beauty as nourishment, defined by the women themselves

**Production needs:**
- 1 large panel/surface (fabric, paper, or board)
- Frame or hanging system
- Gold pens/markers (high quality — not cheap felt tips)
- Optional: small cards + pins if using a pinboard format
- Good lighting on the wall (natural or warm spots)
- Photographer briefed to capture it at multiple stages (empty, half-full, full, close-ups, women writing)

## MARKETING & OUTREACH

### Strategy: Grassroots + Content-Led

**1. Street Interviews — "Bellezza che Nutre"**
- Film short street interviews with women in Genova
- Core question: "What makes you feel beautiful? What nourishes you?"
- Warm, real, unscripted — women of all ages
- At the end of each interview: invite them to the event
- **Use as:** teaser content for IG Reels/TikTok in the weeks before the event
- Creates buzz, introduces EVA's voice, makes the event feel real before it exists
- Film in beautiful Genova locations (centro storico, caruggi, waterfront)
- Tone: curious, warm, never performative

**2. Participants' Networks**
- Every confirmed participant is encouraged to bring / invite 1-2 women
- Simple shareable invite (digital card, not a flyer) they can forward
- Word of mouth is the primary channel — the event should feel like "a friend invited me"

**3. EVA Instagram**
- Street interview reels as teasers (2-3 weeks before)
- Curated posts: the question "what makes you feel beautiful?" as text/graphic
- Partner reveals: introduce each corner/woman briefly
- NO hard sell, no countdown timers, no "limited spots!!" energy
- Invitational tone: "Something is being prepared for you in Genova."

**4. Partner Cross-Promotion**
- Each partner shares to their own audience (La Strega del Castello, Teaps, Martina Geroni, etc.)
- EVA provides them with beautiful shareable assets (not a generic flyer — something they'd want to post)

### Content Production Needs
- [ ] Videographer for street interviews (or founder + phone with good audio)
- [ ] Simple editing (Reels-ready format, subtitles)
- [ ] Digital invite card design
- [ ] 3-4 IG posts/reels pre-event
- [ ] Photographer for day-of (to create post-event content for future gatherings)
