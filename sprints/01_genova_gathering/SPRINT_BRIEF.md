# CURRENT SPRINT — FIRST GENOVA GATHERING

## STATUS: Active

## EVENT GOAL

Women leave feeling nourished, lighter, more connected, and excited to return. The event should create real connections without forcing vulnerability.

## FORMAT (TARGET FEEL)

- "Salotto" vibe: refined, warm, elegant.
- No stage talks. No long presentations.
- Designed around small-group interactions + gentle guided moments.
- Curated corners (only a few, not a fair).
